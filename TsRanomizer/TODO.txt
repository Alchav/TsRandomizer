Remove TODO's
Fix items dropped by bosses after leaving room (shapeshifterboss itemdrop)
Add ItemList
remove orb spell/ring shop
Make 2nd timespinner require timestop & spindle
Add DRM free support 
Hide Console

Routing issues:
gass blocks of entire lake desolation, so if you are able to kill the maw you should also be able to find a gassmask
		Add check to beatable if you can reach gassmask with a accessto past & double jump & swimming suit
If you got access to the past. it doesnt mean you can go back to the future, plz fix

Minor:
Deleting save file does not delete seed representation
Fix render resizing
disable quests maybe?

Ideas:
Make ice orb freeze enemies
Randomize quest items
Timesanity

For Future:
Change replacement items to actual visable items
