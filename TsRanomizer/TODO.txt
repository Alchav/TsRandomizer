Test spawning of timespinner wheel & timespinner spindle item locations when already obtained
try to hide env prefab for timespinner wheel rooms as they are infront of the chests

Known bugs:
Deleting save file does not delete seed representation
Fix render resizing
Menu tooltip is wrong on diffuclty selection screen
Using the transition room near refugee camp without having pyramid keys renders the portal to small
Player obtains meyef when he/she shouldnt yet

Minor:
disable quests maybe?
Replace Replaces to Treasure Chest to replaces to ItemDropPickup

Ideas:
Make ice orb freeze enemies
Randomize quest items
Timesanity (make transition rooms goto either the past or present rooms)
Memorysanity (make memory / jounrals / letters / downloads contain items) 
Upgradeable items (duuble jump => space jump) (Card D => C => B => A)
