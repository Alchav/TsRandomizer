General:
The game considers nightmare as the final boss,
	thus you require atleast access to the past (to break lazer gate), and timespinner wheel, spindle, 3xgear and (essence of space or lightwall spell) to beat the game
Quest are not concidered part of the game, and they wont contain any progression item,
	however Neliste will still offer you an item when you talk to her

Gameplay:
Orb\Ring\Spell shop nolonger available, orbs\rings\spells are dropped from random item locations
Umbra orb is randomized in even if you dont own the password
Achievements cannot be unlocked

Routing:
To prevent got getting stuck in the past when items are still available in the present, 
	the transition room next to the refugee camp can now be used to freely travel back and forth between past and present
When you obtain the pyramid keys, a random transition room is unlocked that could open now routing oppertunities
The temporal gyre is closed, due to its high randomness inside an already randomized timezone, the timezone would be highly unstable
